Hi! My name is Landy, and I am a third-year Computer Science student.
 No, I’m not the nerd who builds websites every Friday night while eating pizza and drinking Coke 
 (sometimes I drink Fanta :D). 
I develop games, AI models, and software for two main purposes: 
 to learn and to have fun. 
  All my projects are ongoing works,
built out of curiosity and shaped by feedback. 
 Feel free to browse, share your thoughts, 
  or reach out if you’d like to collaborate!
